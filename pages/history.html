                    <h2>TAJ MAHAL, AGRA</h2>
                    <p>One can go on praising the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with an uninterrupted flow of adjectives – magnificent, outstanding, amazing, and incredible.

                    <p>Looking at Agra Fort, one would get the impression that for the Mughals, opulence and grandeur were seemingly alien terms.
